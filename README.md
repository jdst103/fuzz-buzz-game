# fuzz-buzz-game

As a player, I should see the game counting up to my number and
substituting the Multiples of 3 and 5 with the appropriate values,
so that I can play the game with my input. As a player, I should be able to exit the game using a key word,
 so that I can stop playing

Used modulus functions
imported time to use time.sleep() for delay in process.
Configured a for loop while on a while loop. this for loop had a range and processed every integer until process stopped. As this for loop was in a while loop, I gave the user the opportunity to continue or stop by breaking the while loop by entering a certain phrase.
